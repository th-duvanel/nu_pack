===============
Immediate goals
===============

See end of this document for "eventual goals".


Remove old libraries
====================

Should file a RM request to ftpmasters for these old crates:

- wayland-commons after the 0.30 wayland stack is uploaded


Unblocking testing migrations
=============================

Run ``dev/rust-excuses.mk refresh all`` to see these in a nice graph.

Run ``dev/rust-regressions.sh`` to analyse autopkgtest regressions.

From the excuses graph, find the lowest crates i.e. those with no arrows going
outwards to other crates. Then run ``dev/list-rdeps.sh @ $lowest_crotes`` to
see which of its rdeps are broken, and need to be fixed.


New packages
============

Use ``dev/list-remaining-deps.sh`` to help you figure out what's missing.

rustfmt-nightly
---------------

note: (stable) rustfmt is shipped as part of src:rustc nowadays..

* rustc-ap-syntax
  * rustc-ap-rustc_data_structures (prepared)
    * rustc-ap-graphviz (needs nightly)
    * rustc-ap-rustc-cratesio-shim (needs nightly)
  * rustc-ap-rustc-errors (depends on the rest of the list here)
  * rustc-ap-rustc-target
  * rustc-ap-serialize (to be uploaded, dep issue?!)
  * rustc-ap-syntax-pos
  * rustc-ap-serialize (fails because of usage of nightly feature)

bat update
----------

syntect is in debian 
Needs syntect => onig => onig-sys => bindgen 0.55 (for librust-bindgen-0.51+runtime-dev)
Disabling syntect in bat causes:
error[E0433]: failed to resolve: use of undeclared type or module `syntect`
 --> src/terminal.rs:4:5


bingrep
-------

* metagoblin

tokei
-----

needs handlebars
which needs pest
which needs ucd-trie

librsvg
-------

see https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=907629  



bench
-----

* packageable

cargo-deb
----------------

* should be packagable


clap v2 dependency list 
-----------------------
structopt used clap v2
dotenv is unmaintained and superseded by dotenvy which uses clap v3; 
hexyl uses clapv4
sniffglue, git-absorb, sha1collision, gcov, libslirp and cargo-binutils depend on structopt
rav1e uses also clap4


GTK stack dependency tree
-------------------------

Since every gtk-rs release is versioned and a lot of crates are affected updating it is a lot of work and only be done if neccessary.
I made this convienient dependency tree to illustrate how to update. You should start at the top and update all sys-crates first.
Then update the regular crates, also from top to bottom. For convinience pass the debs along like this: `./build.sh gstreamer-sys *.deb`.

**Never update just one single package or just some part of this stack! Check if it can be bumped safely!**

To see lists of interesting binary crates, you can run something like::

  $ apt-get install koji-client
  $ koji -p fedora search package 'rust-*' | cut -b6- | dev/filter-binary-crates.sh

Current output (on 2020-01-17), minus stuff already in Debian, is:

  afterburn

Sccache is also helpful for reducing the build-time of things like firefox and thunderbird

In debian :)
