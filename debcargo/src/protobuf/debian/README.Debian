Circular build-dependency
=========================

The code in ``src/well_known_types`` is auto-generated via ``./regenerate.sh``
using tools from the ``protobuf-codegen`` crate, which build-depends on this
crate, thereby forming a circular build dependency.

Therefore, we avoid re-auto-generating the code in the Debian build, to keep
this cyclic build dependency broken.
