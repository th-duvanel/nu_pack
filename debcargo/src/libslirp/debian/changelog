rust-libslirp (4.3.0-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Package libslirp 4.3.0 from crates.io using debcargo 2.4.4
  * Don't relax dependency on mio, it seems the newer version is actually
    needed ( Closes: 981840 )
  * Set collapse_features = true, it seems that the features were already
    collapsed in the package that was uploaded, perhaps this was done
    manually.
