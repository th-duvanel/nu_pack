Description: Utility to share your GPS device on local network
 gps-share has two goals:
 .
  - Share your GPS device on the local network so that all machines in your home
   or office can make use of it.
  - Enable support for standalone (i-e not part of a cellular modem) GPS devices
   in Geoclue. Since Geoclue has been able to make use of network NMEA sources
   since 2015, gps-share works out of the box with Geoclue.
 .
 The latter means that it is a replacement for GPSD and Gypsy.
 While "why not GPSD?" has already been documented, Gypsy has
 been unmaintained for many years now. I did not feel like reviving a dead
 project and I really wanted to code in Rust so I decided to create gps-share.
