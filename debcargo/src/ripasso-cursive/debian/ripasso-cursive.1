.SH USAGE NOTE
ripasso\-cursive reads $HOME/.password\-store/ by default, override this by setting
the PASSWORD_STORE_DIR environmental variable.

If you specify the PASSWORD_STORE_SIGNING_KEY environmental variable, then
ripasso will verify that the .gpg\-id file is correctly signed. Valid values are one or more 40 character pgp fingerprints,
separated by commas.


.SH CONFIG FILE
ripasso reads configuration from $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ripasso/settings.toml

Example config file

[stores]

  [stores.default]

    path = "/home/user/.password\-store/"

    valid_signing_keys = "AF77DAC5B3882EAD316B7312D5B659E1D2FDF0C3"

  [stores.work]

    path = "/home/user/.work_pass/"

    style_path = "/home/user/.config/ripasso/work\-style.toml"



Valid settings for a store are:

path : This is the root path to the password store directory

valid_signing_keys : this setting corresponds to the PASSWORD_STORE_SIGNING_KEY environmental variable

style_path : color and style information for the store, different stores can have different styles and they will
change when you switch store. Documentation on the format can be found here https://docs.rs/cursive_core/0.1.1/cursive_core/theme/index.html

pgp : the pgp implementation to use for the store, valid values are gpg or sequoia

own_fingerprint : if the pgp option is set to sequoia, ripasso needs to know the fingerprint of your own key in order to communicate with gpg\-agent
