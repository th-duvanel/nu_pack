 source code files. It's recommended to compare the licenses in the source code
 with what's mentioned here.

 *ring* is derived from BoringSSL, so the licensing situation in *ring* is
 similar to BoringSSL.
 .
 *ring* uses an ISC-style license like BoringSSL for code in new files,
 including in particular all the Rust code:

 BoringSSL is a fork of OpenSSL. As such, large parts of it fall under OpenSSL
 licensing. Files that are completely new have a Google copyright and an ISC
 license. This license is reproduced at the bottom of this file.
 .
 Contributors to BoringSSL are required to follow the CLA rules for Chromium:
 https://cla.developers.google.com/clas
 .
 Files in third_party/ have their own licenses, as described therein. The MIT
 license, for third_party/fiat, which, unlike other third_party directories, is
 compiled into non-test libraries, is included below.
 .
 The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of the
 OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit. See below
 for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style Open Source
 licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL please contact
 openssl-core@openssl.org.

 The following are Google-internal bug numbers where explicit permission from
 some authors is recorded for use of their work:
