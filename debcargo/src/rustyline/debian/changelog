rust-rustyline (9.1.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Package rustyline 9.1.2 from crates.io using debcargo 2.5.0
  * Update patches for new upstream and current situation in Debian.
    + Move removal of skim dependency from relax-deps.patch to it's own patch
      consistent with other dependency removals.
    + Drop seperate patch for nix and move nix dependency relaxation into
      relax-deps.patch, since code changes for nix are no longer needed.
    + Enforce a minimum version of nix reflecing the upstream dependency,
      continue to allow any higher 0.x version as most nix version bumps
      don't affect most packages.
    + Stop replacing dirs-next with dirs, Debian currently has an appropriate
      version of dirs-next so we may as well use it.
    + Stop patching out assert_matches dev-dependency, Debian now has it.
    + Update remove-rustyline-derive.patch for code changes in new upstream.
    + Remove dependency on clipboard-win, it's not in Debian and is
      presumablly only needed on windows.
