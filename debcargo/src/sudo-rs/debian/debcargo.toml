sudo-rs is a safety-oriented program designed to provide sudo and su
functionalities with a focus on memory safety. The primary aim is to offer
a secure and reliable alternative to traditional sudo, ensuring fewer
vulnerabilities related to memory management.
.
While it aims to be a drop-in replacement for most common sudo use cases,
there are differences in functionality and design. Users should be aware
of these differences and consult the project's documentation for specifics.
