rust-coreutils (0.0.4-1~exp2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Binaries have been moved in usr/lib/cargo/bin/coreutils
    The rational is that some other rust programs are installed
    in this directory (ex: /usr/lib/cargo/bin/fd). So, users might
    add /usr/lib/cargo/bin/ to their PATH and caused some unexpected
    errors if the Rust coreutils binaries aren't behaving like GNU's.
