The Debian version of the flate2 crate does not actually use miniz, but uses
zlib. The "miniz-sys" feature is preserved for compatibility but it actually
activates the zlib feature rather than pulling in the miniz crate.

This is to save packaging effort - zlib is already installed in basically all
Debian systems already.
