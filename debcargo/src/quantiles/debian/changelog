rust-quantiles (0.7.1-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Package quantiles 0.7.1 from crates.io using debcargo 2.5.0
  * Certain unit tests was broken due to debian having a later version of quicktest
    than the upstream version uses. Those test have been disabled and a discussion
    with upstream started here https://github.com/postmates/quantiles/issues/34
