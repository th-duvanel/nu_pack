 Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally
 submitted for inclusion in the work by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0
 license, shall be licensed dual MIT/Apache 2, or Mozilla Public License
 2.0, without any additional terms or conditions.

 We reserve the right to publish future versions of this project under the
 Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL2) instead of the three-licenses scheme
 described above, including all contributions. If such a change occurs,
 it will not affect versions of the project prior to the application of
 the license change.

 At this time we are not entirely certain which of MPL2 or dual MIT/Apache2
 is the best licensing scheme for this project. Both approaches are very
 permissive and we want to keep the door open to changing to MPL2 in the
 future. This project will remain usable under the MIT/Apache2 license
 for the foreseeable future. However, by contributing to this project
 you accept that your contributions may be re-licensed under the Mozilla
 Public License 2.0 without the MIT and Apache2 options.
