rust-lru (0.12.3-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Package lru 0.12.3 from crates.io using debcargo 2.6.1
  * Stop patching hashbrown dependency, what upstream wants now matches
    what Debian has.

rust-lru (0.7.8-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Package lru 0.7.8 from crates.io using debcargo 2.6.1
  * Relax dependency on hashbrown.
  * Remove nightly feature, it seems incompatible with the new hashbrown.
  * Remove dev-dependency on stats-alloc, it's not in debian and doesn't
    seem to be needed.
