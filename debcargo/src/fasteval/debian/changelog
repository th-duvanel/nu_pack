rust-fasteval (0.2.4-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * We can't assume the pointers representation will always be as long as
    the architecture's pointer width: fasteval doesn't prepend 0's for
    smaller values, so it vastly depends on what pointer values are used in
    userspace applications, which we can't control or anticipate.
    In order to fix this, use fixed-width (8 chars) pointer representation in
    all corresponding tests.
