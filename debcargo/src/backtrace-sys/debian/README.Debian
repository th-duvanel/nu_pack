The Debian version of the backtrace-sys crate links against the libbacktrace.a
provided by the libgcc-*-dev package in active use by Debian, which is updated
more frequently than the rust upstream version of the code.

The rust bugfixes to their fork of libbacktrace are mostly not relevant for
Debian and are for other platforms such as windows.
