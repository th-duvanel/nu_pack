rust-clap (3.2.16-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Package clap 3.2.16 from crates.io using debcargo 2.5.0 (Closes: 1016409)
  * Drop empty patch no-clippy.patch
  * Drop disable-criterion.patch, rust-criterion is now in Debian.
  * Update remaining patches for new upstream
  * Disable unstable-v4 feature to avoid adding a new binary package.
  * Remove dev-dependency on snapbox, it's not in Debian and the tests that use it do not appear
    to be included in the crates.io release.
  * Remove dependency of "deprecated" feature on "clap_derive/deprecated", this
    avoids the generation of an additional binary package, and the "deprecated"
    feature is only used to enable additional deprecation warnings so it's not
    super-important.
  * Make once-cell dependency non optional to avoid generating an aditional
    binary package.
  * Prevent generatoin of "clap" binary package that appeared with the update to
    the new upstream version. The only binary that ends up in it appears to be
    a trivial test program.
