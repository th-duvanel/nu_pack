  * Drop quickcheck feature for now, we don't have a suitable version of
    quickcheck in Debian.

  * Remove dev-dependencies on criterion, serde_test and trybuild which are only
    used by tests/benches that are not included in the crates.io release.

    time-macros crate which is not currently in debian.

    is currently disabled and even if it wasn't they would limit
    our ability to test other features given how autopkgtests currently
    handle features.
