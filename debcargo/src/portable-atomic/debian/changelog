rust-portable-atomic (1.4.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Package portable-atomic 1.4.3 from crates.io using debcargo 2.6.0
  * Update gate-tests.patch for new upstream.
  * Add patch to eliminate test_helper subcrate, which is not included in the
    crates.io release.
  * Set test_is_broken for the unsafe-assume-single-core, disable-fiq, s-mode
    and critical-section features, they only make sense on "bare-metal" targets.
  * Eliminate dev-dependency on build-context crate, this makes the testsuite
    slightly less general, but it's still fine for our purposes.
  * Relax dev-dependency on fastrand to allow 1.8.
