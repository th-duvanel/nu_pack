rust-procfs (0.14.2-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Package procfs 0.14.2 from crates.io using debcargo 2.6.0
  * Further autopkgtest tweaks based on debci logs.
    + Don't fail tests if "meminfo map is not empty", this can happen when
      the kernel adds new features.
    + Don't fail tests if /proc/cpuinfo doesn't contain model or vendor
      information.
    + Don't fail tests if /proc/cpuinfo has only one CPU entry, but the
      system has multiple cores according to stat.cpu_time, this seems
      to happen on some arm systems.

rust-procfs (0.14.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Package procfs 0.14.2 from crates.io using debcargo 2.6.0
  * Bump rustix dependency to 0.37
  * Tweak tests so they work in a broader range of environments.
  * Remove dev-dependencies on failure and procfs and disable tests
    that depend on them so the rest of the testsuite can run.
  * Disable test_task_runsinglethread, it seems to fail on
    overloaded/throttled systems.
