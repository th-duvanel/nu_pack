rust-value-bag (1.0.0~alpha.9-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Package value-bag 1.0.0-alpha.9 from crates.io using debcargo 2.5.0
  * Disable serde-fmt and sval related features for now, they can be renabled
    if/when those packages are in Debian (Closes: #1020484)
  * Add alloc feature to erased-serde dependency, it fails to build without
    at least one of std or alloc.
  * Remove dev-dependency on wasm-bindgen-test, it's not in Debian and doesn't
    seem to be needed to run the tests on Linux.
  * Override and manually fix debian/tests/control, it seems debcargo gets the
    crate directory wrong for alpha versions.
