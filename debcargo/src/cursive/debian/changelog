rust-cursive (0.20.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Package cursive 0.20.0 from crates.io using debcargo 2.5.0
  * Drop use-wasmer-enumset-instead-of-enumset.patch, enumset is now in Debian.
  * Drop upgrade-to-crossterm-0.25.patch, upstream has updated.
  * Update remove-terminals-not-in-debian.patch for new upstream
  * Remove newly added "ansi" feature, which depends on the ansi feature
    in cursive-core which depends on ansi-parser which is not yet in Debian.
  * Bump cursive_core dependency to ensure we build against a version
    of cursive_core that uses enumset rather than wasmer-enumset.
  * Revert upstream bump of ahash dependency.
