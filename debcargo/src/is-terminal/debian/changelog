rust-is-terminal (0.4.9-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Package is-terminal 0.4.9 from crates.io using debcargo 2.6.0
  * Relax rustix dependency to ">= 0.37.0, < 1.0" to mitigate effects of
    dependency cycle.
  * Disable tests that depend on rustix::stdio, which did not exist in rustix
    0.37, the functions existed in a different place, but there doesn't seem
    a good way to conditionally use different locations based on the version
    of a dependency.

  * Team upload.

  * Reinstate libc dev-dependency which seems to have been patched away by
    mistake, breaking the autopkgtest.
  * Stop patching rustix dependency, the version required by this upstream
    version of is-terminal matches the version currently in Debian.
  * Update disable-windows.diff for new upstream.
