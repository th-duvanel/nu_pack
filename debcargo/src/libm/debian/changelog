rust-libm (0.2.1-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Package libm 0.2.1 from crates.io using debcargo 2.5.0
  * Apply an upstream fix that fixes a build error when manually running
    cargo test (this doesn't seem to apply when running under cargo_auto_test,
    it appears cargo_auto_test overrides the maximum lint level somehow).
  * Update x87 patches to more closely match what was accepted upstream
    and to fix most errors in release mode as well as debug mode.
