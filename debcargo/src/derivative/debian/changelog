rust-derivative (2.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Package derivative 2.2.0 from crates.io using debcargo 2.6.0
  * Disable derive-debug-generics test, it's already failing in testing, and
    already reported upstream, so running it in debci is doing more harm than
    good at this point.
  * Remove upper limit from trybuild dev-dependency, upstream set it for msrv
    reasons which are irrelevent to Debian.
