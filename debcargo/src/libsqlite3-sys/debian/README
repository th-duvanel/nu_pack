Rust's libsqlite3-sys crate in Debian
=====================================

- The debian package for the libsqlite3-sys crate does not support the
  bundled variants or features (for more explanation why, see
  https://wiki.debian.org/EmbeddedCopies)

- It also does not support building Windows-specific variants (e.g.,
  winsqlite3): we don't have the infrastructure within debian to build
  them.

- It also does not ship the bundled_bindings feature, because those
  bundled bindings are autogenerated in a process that we cannot
  replicate.  Instead, dependent packages are encouraged to use the
  "buildtime_bindgen" feature.

- Using the sqlcipher feature is unlikely to work well as long as the
  debian version of sqlcipher is out-of-date (see #1017577).
