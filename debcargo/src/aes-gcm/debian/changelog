rust-aes-gcm (0.10.3-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix autopkgtests by only running those with a chance of success
    The tests for this crate require both the `aes` and `alloc` feature to
    be enabled, so there's no point in running them with a single feature
    enabled, as they're bound to fail by design.
