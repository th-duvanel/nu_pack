description = """
A compressor and decompressor for brotli with an interface avoiding the rust stdlib.
This makes it suitable for embedded devices and kernels.
It is designed with a pluggable allocator so that the standard lib's allocator may be employed.
The default build also includes a stdlib allocator and stream interface.
Disable this with --features=no-stdlib. All included code is safe.
