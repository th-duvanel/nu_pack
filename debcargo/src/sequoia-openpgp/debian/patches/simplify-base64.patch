Subject: Simplify base64 dependency.

Debian currently has rust-base64 version 0.21.7.  Updating debian to
rust-base64 0.22 potentially affects dozens of packages.

The debian build daemons don't really handle "or"ed build-deps safely:
they choose the first one, and ignore the rest, which means that
they'll take the highest-value.  So, to simplify the update in debian,
we tighten this dependency.  if rust-base64 0.22 lands in debian, this
patch should be removed.
